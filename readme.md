https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g90irqWEqd8 (Async JavaScript with Promises)

* with my webstorm IDE *(I believe)* i just need to run as debug which will automatically refresh the browser

part of the ECMA6 proposal, but has been around a while via third-parties
available in all major browsers except IE (11 even)


    let promise = {
        then: function() {},
        catch: function() {}
    }

* the `then` function is called anytime the **promise** is successful.

* http://localhost:9966

* adapted to use `express` instead of `budo`
* running gives this error `(node:12484) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 2): TypeError: xhr.open is not a function`

* also, having problem running in-browser. right now it just says `Cannot GET /` which i know how to deal with since it's in `express`. before with `budo` i didn't know how to deal with that error message, which was as I term "chrome-level": `This site canâ€™t be reached.  localhost refused to connect.`
