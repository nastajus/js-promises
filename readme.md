https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g90irqWEqd8 (Async JavaScript with Promises)

* with my webstorm IDE *(I believe)* i just need to run as debug which will automatically refresh the browser

part of the ECMA6 proposal, but has been around a while via third-parties
available in all major browsers except IE (11 even)


    let promise = {
        then: function() {},
        catch: function() {}
    }

* the `then` function is called anytime the **promise** is successful.
